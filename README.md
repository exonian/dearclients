===========

A collaborative resource from web professionals for clients who want a website done.

## Reason

Clients sometimes say the darndest things. There are a lot of misconceptions and assumptions from them starting from the way DNS works (we've set the A records NOW, why can't I see the site?) to SEO (why doesn't my site come up on number one?) to pricing questions (how much does a 50 page site cost? or just how much does a website cost?). We've all had these conversations. Let's collect our collective knowledge and...

## Result

... put together a resource here, on Github as a page that we can refer clients to. It would help our communication, and neither us, nor them, would spend time explaining things over and over again. I know that part of our job is to educate clients (ref: Paul Boag and Mike Monteiro), but I have the growing need for a resource where I can go and see how different concepts are explained clearly. Sometimes I'm not the most verbose of people.

## How?

I made this repo 10 minutes after I had the idea, so I'm not entirely clear on all the details, however a few things I am:

* markdown should be used for all articles
* open issues for topics, let's have a discussion, and let's write the articles. PRs are the way to go!

## Licensing

I'd love this to be free for anyone to use, while also making sure no one can make a copy and claim they've written the entire thing and then sell it as an ebook. I'm not a lawyer, so pointers are welcome. This is the best I've found so far: [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
